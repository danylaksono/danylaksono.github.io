Greetings! I am a lecturer and researcher in [Department of Geodetic Engineering](http://geodesi.ugm.ac.id/), [Universitas Gadjah Mada Yogyakarta](https://www.danylaksono.com/www.ugm.id). My research interests are in the field of 3D Geospatial Information, including 3D modeling using structure from motion, analysis and visualization. I also work on gamification and crowdsourcing 3D geospatial data using location-based augmented reality. As a side project I also utilize spatial data mining from social media data to obtain information for behavioral studies, espescially those related to geospatial visualization and insights.

I also have special interest in NoSQL database for geospatial apllication, and thus I often develop WebGIS app using MEAN framework (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular and NodeJS), as well as hybrid framework based on Angular (Ionic). I love opensource and would promote the use of open source software whenever available as alternative to paid ones.

I believe that the future of Geomatics would be large and larger scale of geospatial data: whether on data acquisition, analysis and visualization (imagine a 1:1 3D realtime model of the real-world!). Thus I am eager to the discussion on Digital Twin technologies from geospatial point-of-view. Should you find my papers or articles interesting, I’d love to have a discussion :)
