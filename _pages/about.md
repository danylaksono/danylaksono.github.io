Greetings! I am a lecturer and researcher in the [Department of Geodetic Engineering](http://geodesi.ugm.ac.id/) at [Universitas Gadjah Mada Yogyakarta](www.ugm.id). Currently, I'm a research student at [giCentre, City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/research/centres/gicentre) focusing on visual analytics and geo-visualization. I am working with [Advanced Infrastructure Technology Ltd.](https://advanced-infrastructure.co.uk/team)) on tackling the issues of large geospatial data visualisation and visual analytics for decision making related to energy networks, espescially in alignment with the UK's target for the [Net Zero Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy). I investigate different techniques and their roles in cartography and geo-visualisation to encode multivariate geospatial data. 

Some of my past research is in the field of 3D Geospatial Information, including 3D modeling using Structure from Motion, analysis and 3D visualisation. I've also worked on gamification and crowdsourcing 3D geospatial data using location-based Augmented Reality. As a side project I also utilized spatial data mining from social media and other arbitrary sources to obtain information for behavioral studies, espescially those related to geospatial visualisation and insights. Please find some of my works on my [Github page](https://github.com/danylaksono/) and some of the recent visualisation on my [Observable page](https://observablehq.com/@danylaksono). I love Open Source (looking at you, [QGIS](https://qgis.org)!) and promote the use of open source software whenever possible.

I believe that the future of Geomatics will involve a larger scale of geospatial data: be it on data acquisition, analysis and analytics, and especially visualization (imagine a 1:1 3D realtime model of the real-world!). Thus I am eager to the discussion on Digital Twin technologies from a geospatial point-of-view. Should you find works interesting, I’d love to have a discussion :)
